Are you listening
To the beat on my mind?
Are you listening?
Do you think of me?
Am I wasting my time?
Do you think of me?

I really ain't sober
I wanna come over
I wanna get closer
Come hold me down
You got me all hazy
You got me all crazy
You got me like, baby
Come hold me down (hold me down)

Running though my head like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
Wanna say your name like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra

Running though my head like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
Wanna say your name like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra

When you're on my lips
I don't wanna behave
When you're on my lips (on my lips, on my lips)
Got you on repeat
And I like, yeah I like you on my brain
Got you on repeat (on repeat, on repeat)

I really ain't sober
I wanna come over
I wanna get closer
Come hold me down
You got me all hazy
You got me all crazy
You got me like, baby
Come hold me down (hold me down)

Running though my head like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
Wanna say your name like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra

Running though my head like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
Wanna say your name like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra

(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
Hold me down

Really ain't sober
Wanna come over
Wanna get closer
Come hold me down
Got me all hazy
Got me all crazy
Got me like, baby
Come hold me down (hold me down)

Running though my head like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
Wanna say your name like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra

Running though my head like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
Wanna say your name like
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra

(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Like you're my mantra, oh my mantra
