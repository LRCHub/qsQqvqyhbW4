Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
This that pretty-girl mantra,
this that flaunt ya,
just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama
'less we wanna,
it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed
in a Defender,
know I'ma defend her,
never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra,
she's that stunna,
make you wanna swing both ways
Mix me with the drama
Check you like commas
My clothes are pajamas
Straight from the cold plunge
Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit
for the night
Swеrvin' through the lane,
we'll bе twenty minute late
'Cause we had to do
an In-N-Out drive-by
It's not that deep,
I'm not that drunk
Sometimes,
girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back, all that ass
Me and my sis, way too attached
It's not that deep,
we're not that dumb
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowin' like the sun
You're gonna feel this every day
This that pretty-girl mantra,
this that flaunt ya,
just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama
'less we wanna,
it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed
in a Defender,
know I'ma defend her,
never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra,
she's that stunna,
make you wanna swing both ways
Love what it feel like
To be off of the grid
like all night
Oh, with my bih, like
We ain't even tryna talk no one
Swerve off all the creeps,
no weird vibes
We ain't never let it ruin
a good time
Ain't nobody gon' dim
our good light
This them words we're livin' by
This that pretty-girl mantra,
this that flaunt ya,
just touched down in L.A.
Pretty girls don't do drama
'less we wanna,
it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed
in a Defender,
know I'ma defend her,
never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra,
she's that stunna,
make you wanna swing both ways
This that pretty-girl mantra,
this that flaunt ya,
just touched down in L.A.
Pretty girls don't do trauma,
no new drama,
we already got a full day
Pretty girls that
you gon' remember,
know that you could never,
nothing ever trigger me
This that pretty-girl mantra,
she's that stunna,
everyone knows she is me
Hahahahahahaha
