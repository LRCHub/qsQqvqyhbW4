We light the oil
And touch the beads.
The naked feel
Of rosary .

The fall of morning
On the lands.
The smell of incense
On our hands.

We kneel
Before the open grave.
And light
The candles with our pain.

Because all things
Will change.
Because they stay the same
We live again

We learn
The consequence of sin.
We roll our eyes
And touch our skin.

We feel
Eternity expressed
With every word,
With every breath.

We kneel
Before the open grave.
And light
The candles with our pain.

Because the seasons
Change.
Because they stay the same
We live again.

We kneel
Before the open grave.
And light
The candles with our pain.

Because all things
Will change.
And as your God explains,
We live again.

We live again.

We live again.

We live again.
